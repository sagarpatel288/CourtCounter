# CourtCounter
initial commit

This app is the part of Google India Challenge Scholarship for Android Basics Track Lesson 9.

The application intention is to make basic java concepts like local and global variables, methods and android click events clear by 
tracking and updating basic user input.

There are two basketball teams for which user can update score, see the result and reset the game.

Additionally, I have tweaked the original application in terms of background, text colors, styles and functionalities to cover 
all the concept from lesson 1 to 9.

Thank you
Best Regards,
Sagar
